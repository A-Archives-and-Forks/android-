# Nearby-Sharing-Windows
`Nearby-Sharing-Windows` is an app for `Android`, to send files and urls from your phone to a `Windows 10 / 11` device using the build-in sharing functionality ([Project Rome]( https://github.com/microsoft/project-rome)).

## Receive data
I’m currently working on a receiving functionality (PC ➜ Android).   
That involves creating a custom implementation of the protocol (including encryption).    
You can track the status in [#8](https://github.com/ShortDevelopment/Nearby-Sharing-Windows/issues/8).

## Building
This is a new `Xamarin.Android` project based on `net6.0`.   
You can use `Visual Studio 2022` to build and deploy the app.
