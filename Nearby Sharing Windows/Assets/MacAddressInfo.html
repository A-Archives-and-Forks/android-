<b><u>Required Action</u></b>
<br />
Because of privacy concerns (ads), android does not allow apps to read your Bluetooth mac address any more.
<br />
But it's required to tell the other device where to send your data.
<br />
To proceed, please insert your Bluetooth mac address below.
<br />
You can find it in the settings at <i>System <b>></b> About <b>></b> Bluetooth MAC address</i>.
<br />
If this address is invalid, you will not be able to receive any data!
