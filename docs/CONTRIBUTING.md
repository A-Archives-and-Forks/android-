## General
Have a look at open issues

- [help-wanted](https://github.com/nearby-sharing/android/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) for more complex work that may require specific knowledge

Before you start working on sth serious: Discuss with prior contributors in an open issue or on Discord.   
But you may of cause experiment without asking ðŸ˜Š.

## Android developers
We are using Material You for the android app.   
I'm always glad for UI / Design support.   
Have a look at [`area::UI-UX`](https://github.com/nearby-sharing/android/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea%3A%3AUI-UX).

The logic is implemented using direct mappings of the android apis into c#.   
If you happen to know both: Amazing!   
If not: It's not that difficult to learn either of them ðŸ˜‰.   
We always need people upgrading to the latest android apis or implementing new platform-specific features.

## Gtk developers
We are working on a new UI app for linux.   
Checkout the [repo](https://github.com/nearby-sharing/linux).

## .NET developers
The core library is written in pure c#, no platform-specific knowledge required!   
Have a look at issues with the label [`area::libCdp`](https://github.com/nearby-sharing/android/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aarea%3A%3AlibCdp%20state%3Aopen).
